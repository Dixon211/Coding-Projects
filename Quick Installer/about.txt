6/4 made the GUI

Working on the file explorer to get the metadata needed for the programs(name, binary data, file extension)
    attached to click on the "add add_prgm_but"
    using the filechooser to choose the correct installer
    break down metadata from the file
    have the metadata moved to the SQLdb that is created in quick_install.py
    *don't add more work to this, see the moving of this metadata as one function. We will make another one to pull it to the left side.
